      Girl, Stop Apologizing: A Shame-Free Plan for Embracing and Achieving Your
      Goals
    </h3>
    <h5 class="author">by Rachel Hollis</h5>
    <p class="description">
      “I believe we can change the world. But first, we’ve got to stop living in
      fear of being judged for who we are.” Rachel Hollis has seen it too often:
      women not living into their full potential. They feel a tugging on their
      hearts for something more, but they’re afraid of embarrassment, of falling
      short of perfection, of not being enough. In Girl, Stop Apologizing, #1
      New York Times bestselling author and founder of a multimillion-dollar
      media company, Rachel Hollis sounds a wake-up call. She knows that many
      women have been taught to define themselves in light of other
      people—whether as wife, mother, daughter, or employee—instead of learning
      how to own who they are and what they want. With a challenge to women
      everywhere to stop talking themselves out of their dreams, Hollis
      identifies the excuses to let go of, the behaviors to adopt, and the
      skills to acquire on the path to growth, confidence, and believing in
      yourself.
